# 2D Wheeled Robot Dynamics Simulation
## Description
This project aims to simulate a [differential drive robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_wheeled_robot) by implementing the dynamics of the vehicle
on a virtual environment.

## Motivation
Even though my background is in Computer Engineering, I enjoy learning about physical machines like robots. I wanted to learn how robots move and insteract with the world
around them. What better way than to build my own simulator?

## Resources
This simulation is currently being built using Python coding language and the [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/#:~:text=PyQt5%20is%20a%20comprehensive%20set,platforms%20including%20iOS%20and%20Android.)
framework.

## Setup

## Next Step
Currently working on sliders in order or manually steer the robot

## What I've Learned
* Wheeled robot dynamics
